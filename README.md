This project contains my work done for MIT Opencourseware's class 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python, Problem Set 4. Included in addition to my code are the instructions for the problem set, a story.text file containing an encrypted story, and a word.txt file that the ciphers use.
